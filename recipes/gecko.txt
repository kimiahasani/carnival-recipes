Audrey's Meatloaf
--------------

Ingredients:
Time: 1 hour
1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
2 pounds Ground Beef
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon

6 slices White Bread
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 cup Brown Sugar


3. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, seasoned salt, salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beaten eggs.
4. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
