Audrey's Meatloaf
--------------
6 slices White Bread
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 cup Brown Sugar

5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.

Time: 1 hour

1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley

6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
