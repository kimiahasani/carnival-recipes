Audrey's Meatloaf
--------------
Time: 1 hour

1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
6 slices White Bread
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon

2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.


6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.

11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
